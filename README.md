# Social-Media-Mining
Keren Zhou and Xiao Zhang's Homework for Social Network Mining.

###Description

This is a simple **C++** library in social network mining, which includes classical network models and measures.

The major aim of the library is to illustrate the key procedures and concept in social networks, therefore we deal with
the trade-off between complex encapsulation and brief demonstration. We believe that we show some good examples of
 graph algorithm.
 
For brevity and efficiency, we do not implement our own *Allocator*, and *Containers* and *Iterators* are from combing **STL** components. Currently our library support basic operations of the *Graph*. It also has friendly interfaces to extending new structures and functions.
 
We will present the examples of using the library in the next version, with pictures illustraing the internal structures, and codes of simple operations. 

###Progress
