# Mining-Social-Datasets
Keren Zhou and Xiao Zhang's Homework for Social Network Mining.

###Description

This is a simple **C++** library in social network mining, which includes classical network models and measures.

The major aim of the library is to illustrate the key procedure and concept in social networks, therefore we deal with
the trade-off between efficient implementing and brief demonstration. We believe that we show some good examples of
 graph algorithm.
 
Currently our library is under construction.
